# My assignment application

Notes

* Based on create-t3-app.
* Wile I tried to stick to the AntD component system as much as possible; I haven't worked with it ever before, and I struggled a little. So I relied on Tailwindcss to get the job done. Hope you don't mind.
* I didn't have time to implement the external DB, so I fell back on mocking the "favorites" feature with localStorage.
* I haven't had the opportunity to test on Safari; I hope it's not broken beyond recognition.

Generally fun to build, and I also might have accidentally learned some Chinese.
